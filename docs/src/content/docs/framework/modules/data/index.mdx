title: Documents and Nodes
description: Data structure for storing data in vectorstores
---

`Document`s and `Node`s are the basic building blocks of data in vectorstores. While the API for these objects is similar, `Document` objects represent entire files, while `Node`s are smaller pieces of that original document, that are suitable for an LLM and Q&A.

```typescript
import { Document } from "@vectorstores/core";

document = new Document({ text: "text", metadata: { key: "val" } });
```
