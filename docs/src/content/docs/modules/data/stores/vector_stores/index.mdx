title: Vector Stores
---

Available Vector stores save embedding vectors of your ingested document chunks.

## Search Modes

Most vector stores in this library support the following search modes:

- **Default**: Standard vector similarity search using embeddings.
- **BM25**: Keyword search using the BM25 algorithm.
- **Hybrid**: A combination of vector similarity search and BM25 keyword search.

### Scoring Formats

The score returned for each node depends on the search mode used:

- **Default (Vector)**: Scores are based on cosine similarity and range from **0.0 to 1.0**, where 1.0 indicates a perfect semantic match.
- **BM25**: Scores are calculated using the BM25 algorithm. These scores are **unbounded** (can be greater than 1.0) and represent keyword relevance. Higher scores indicate better matches.
- **Hybrid**: Scores are calculated using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). RRF scores are typically **very small** (e.g., a rank 1 result has a score of $\approx 0.0164$ or $1.64\%$). This method is robust as it only considers the rank position from each sub-search, not the raw similarity or BM25 scores.

You can specify the search mode in the `query` method of the vector store:

```typescript
const result = await vectorStore.query({
  queryStr: "your keyword query",
  queryEmbedding: [0.1, 0.2, ...],
  mode: "hybrid",
  similarityTopK: 5,
  alpha: 0.5, // Importance of vector search vs keyword search (0.0 to 1.0)
});
```

### Native vs Fallback Support

Where possible, this library uses the native hybrid and BM25 implementations of the underlying vector store (e.g., Weaviate, ElasticSearch, MongoDB Atlas, PostgreSQL). If a vector store does not support these modes natively, a fallback implementation is used where possible.
