title: Vector Stores
---

Available Vector stores save embedding vectors of your ingested document chunks.

## Search Modes

Most vector stores in this library support the following search modes:

- **Default**: Standard vector similarity search using embeddings.
- **BM25**: Keyword search using the BM25 algorithm.
- **Hybrid**: A combination of vector similarity search and BM25 keyword search.

You can specify the search mode in the `query` method of the vector store:

```typescript
const result = await vectorStore.query({
  queryStr: "your keyword query",
  queryEmbedding: [0.1, 0.2, ...],
  mode: "hybrid",
  similarityTopK: 5,
  alpha: 0.5, // Importance of vector search vs keyword search (0.0 to 1.0)
});
```

### Native vs Fallback Support

Where possible, this library uses the native hybrid and BM25 implementations of the underlying vector store (e.g., Weaviate, ElasticSearch, MongoDB Atlas, PostgreSQL). If a vector store does not support these modes natively, a fallback implementation is used where possible.
