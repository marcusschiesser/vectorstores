title: Index
---

A `VectorStoreIndex` is the basic container for organizing your data. It retrieves the top-k `Node`s that can be sent to an LLM for generating a response. The default top-k is 2.

```typescript
import { Document, VectorStoreIndex } from "@vectorstores/core";

const document = new Document({ text: "test" });

const index = await VectorStoreIndex.fromDocuments([document]);
```

:::note[How documents are stored]
`VectorStoreIndex.fromDocuments` does not store documents directly in the vector store. Instead, documents are first split into smaller chunks called `Node`s. Each node contains a reference to its source document and is what actually gets embedded and stored in the vector store. This chunking allows for more precise retrieval and better context matching when querying.
