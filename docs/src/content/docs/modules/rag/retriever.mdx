title: Retriever
---

A retriever in vectorstores is what is used to fetch `Node`s from an index using a query string.

- [VectorIndexRetriever](/api/classes/vectorindexretriever/) will fetch the top-k most similar nodes. Ideal for dense retrieval to find most relevant nodes.

```typescript
const retriever = vectorIndex.asRetriever({
  similarityTopK: 3,
});

// Fetch nodes!
const nodesWithScore = await retriever.retrieve({ query: "query string" });
```

### Interpreting Scores

The `score` returned with each node varies based on the retrieval mode:

- **Vector search**: Scores (0.0 to 1.0) represent cosine similarity.
- **BM25 search**: Scores are unbounded and represent keyword relevance.
- **Hybrid search**: Scores are based on Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) and are typically small (e.g., ~0.016 for rank 1).

For more details on search modes and scoring, see the [Vector Stores](/modules/data/stores/vector_stores) documentation.
